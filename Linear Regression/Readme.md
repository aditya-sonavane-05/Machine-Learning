Linear regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fit line through the data points, which can then be used to make predictions or estimate the value of one variable based on the value of another.

There are two types of linear regression: simple linear regression and multiple linear regression. Simple linear regression involves a single independent variable and a dependent variable, while multiple linear regression involves two or more independent variables and a dependent variable.

The equation for a simple linear regression model is:

y = a + bx

where y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, a is the y-intercept (the value of y when x is zero), and b is the slope (the rate of change of y with respect to x). The equation for a multiple linear regression model is similar, but with additional independent variables:

y = a + b1x1 + b2x2 + ... + bnxn

where x1, x2, ..., xn are the independent variables, and b1, b2, ..., bn are their respective slopes.

The process of fitting a linear regression model involves finding the values of a and b (or a, b1, b2, ..., bn) that minimize the sum of the squared errors between the predicted values and the actual values. This is typically done using a technique called ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.

Linear regression can be used for a wide range of applications, including predicting stock prices, estimating the impact of advertising on sales, and analyzing the relationship between temperature and air conditioning usage. However, it is important to note that linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the variables, and may not be appropriate for all types of data. Additionally, linear regression is sensitive to outliers and influential points in the data, and may require additional preprocessing steps to address these issues.
