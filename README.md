# Machine-Learning
Welcome to my Github repository about machine learning!
This repository is dedicated to providing resources and code samples for those interested in learning about machine learning.

In this repository, you'll find a collection of Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, and data sets that cover a wide range of machine learning topics, including but not limited to:

-Supervised learning
-Unsupervised learning
-Reinforcement learning
-Deep learning
-Natural Language Processing
-Computer Vision

Each notebook or script includes detailed explanations and comments to help you understand the code and the concepts behind it. We also provide relevant data sets to help you get started with your own projects.
